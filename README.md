Codes for "A Data-Driven Recurrent Event Model for System Degradation with Imperfect Maintenance Actions", IISE Transactions  DOI:10.1080/24725854.2021.1871687

The codes are used to generate and estimate a multivariate stochastic process, where different stochastic processes have their respective baselines, and are associated to each other through an impact matrix. 
For more details on the process and mathematical background, please see the attached article.

The repo consists of four R source codes. 'main.R' should be executed to simulate, plot, and estimate the proposed multivariate stochastic process.
